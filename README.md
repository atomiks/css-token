# CSS Token

[CSS Token](https://css-token.netlify.app) provides a set of design tokens
and utilities that enable a standardized system to specify colors, sizes, shadows,
and other design-related values in your app.

- **Minimal**: No build step, easily use with inline styles via
  [CSS Hooks](https://css-hooks.com)<sup>1</sup>.
- **Flexible**: Static and dynamic tokens for custom use cases.
- **SSR-safe**: Tokens work on the server and client.
- **Strongly typed**: Tokens can be narrowly typed to prevent invalid values.

[View the docs](https://css-token.netlify.app) for more information.

> solution that lets you to "hook" into CSS features like `:hover` and media
> queries _directly_ from the `style` prop. With minimal overhead, you enjoy the
> benefits of local reasoning, reusing your existing knowledge of standard CSS,
> strong typing, while being SSR-safe.
